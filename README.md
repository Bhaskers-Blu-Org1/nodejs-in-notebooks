# Using Node.js Data Science notebooks

## Introduction
Notebooks (that’s Jupyter/IPython notebooks, not Moleskine® notebooks) are where data scientists process, analyse, and visualise data in an iterative, collaborative environment. If you are a developer, but not a data scientist, and like the idea of having a scratchpad where you can write some code, iteratively work on some algorithms, and visualise the results quickly, we'll invote you to explore the world of *nodebooks*.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
To get started with nodebook you'll need a local installation of 
 * Jupyter
 * Node.js

> Nodebooks are currently _not supported_ by the [Watson Data Platform](http://datascience.ibm.com/analytics).
 
### Accessing the samples

To access the sample nodebooks, clone this repository and launch a Jupyter server on your local machine.

```
 $ git clone https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/nodebook-code-pattern
 $ cd nodebook-code-pattern
 $ jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

## Part 1: Variables, functions, and promises

* [Nodebook 1](https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/nodebook-code-pattern/blob/master/notebooks/nodebooks_part_1.ipynb) describes how to use variables, functions, and promises in Python notebooks.

***
## Part 2: Working with data sources

* [Nodebook 2](https://github.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/nodebook-code-pattern/blob/master/notebooks/nodebooks_part_2.ipynb) outlines how to access external data sources, such as Apache CouchDB or it's managed sibling Cloudant.
